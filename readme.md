LiteCache
=========

This is the main repository of the SilentByte LiteCache Library.

LiteCache is a lightweight, easy-to-use, and straightforward caching library for PHP that tries to utilize PHP's built in caching mechanisms. Advanced caching systems such as [Memcached](https://memcached.org/) are often not available on cheap hosting providers while simple code / opcode caching is. LiteCache generates `*.php` files for stored objects which then can be optimized and cached by the execution environment.
